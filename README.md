# To-Do App

A To-Do App created using Expo with React Native and TypeScript. 

This was a test project to teach myself the basics of React Native with TypeScript.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
